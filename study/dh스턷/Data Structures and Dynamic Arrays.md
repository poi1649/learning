### Interface
- Specification
- What data can store
- What operations are supported

### Data Structure
- representation
- how to store data
- algorithm to support operations

Tell me differences between Interface and Data Structure

How can we randomly access to any elements in Constant time?

Why the insert_at operation and delete_at operation in static array costs linear time?

In Dynamic Array, how can we optimize the time complexity in the insert operation.
